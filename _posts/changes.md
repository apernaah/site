So, I was thinking... If I write more about myself, I might get doxxed out in the real world quick, but I want this as an option to let the world who I am as well. Whenever someone says something about themselves, I have this urge to tell about myself, which is quite natural but it leads to my identity, my dead name as it is public information at this point. I love who I was (As in not the body, the Identity), I was a loving son for my parents, a loving brother for my brother, and a caring boyfriend. If they accept me, I can be a loving daughter and a sister, nothing's gonna change (well, except for the body and the name). I'm still the same person. Just because I changed my gender and name doesn't make me less of who I am. I know I'm gonna lose a lot of friends and family, but I'll always be the same friend, mentor, student, whatever you know me as. 

I was depressed having this body and envious of the female body always, because of the choices they have for clothing. Weirdly, I never cared for accessories, but that's slowly changing somehow because my male body considers it weird to have. The accessories thing I mentioned and a few other things I'll be writing about would refer to [Managed Dysphoria](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/managed-dysphoria).

My coming out story is special, I was always surrounded by people who judged me, like: hey, look it's S's son, A' brother. Everyone looked at me and constantly judged, questioned, and had mostly negative reactions to whatever I said. So I kept this inside me for like 9-10 years already, but then I started talking about this to Vector whom I met online, and it gave me confidence, because they never judged. I told this to someone else online and they also didn't judge, so I proceeded to tell it to my friend from back home who came here to pursue her masters, I went to her place and told her expecting that she would start lashing out but that was amazing, she didn't judge, she didn't give any negative reactions, she just listened and asked questions. This is the point where I chose I should be Aparna (had the name secretly for 10 years, btw). If she had said anything negative, I would've kept it inside and chosen to live the life to satisfy society and family.

I think this might go on and on, so i'll publish my coming out as another post.

I was always scared of talking to girls my age, mainly because of the FOMO, and I used to think they'd find it weird and easily figure out that I was... different. I know these are just preferences and do not support my argument but hear me out: I love rom-coms, feel-good movies, classical, pop and romantic songs, I love cute things, anything girly and I love bright stuff and I hate rap music. I don't follow football (I love playing tho). 

I should give clarity about my gaming part: I started playing PC games at a very young age (4 I guess), I was always fond of it and ever since I found an option to switch to a female character, I always did that; people thought it was because I liked seeing a girl. Nope, how would you justify that statement if I chose a female driver in the Forza Horizon series? If someone were to audit my history of games, they'll notice that all the characters I played was female. Road Rash, GTA VC, GTA SA (Had to change all the textures of CJ with Mona Sax from Max Payne), PUBG, Valorant (Killjoy), GTA Online, Watch Dogs Legion, and my favourite "The Sims 4".

I love talking to people (but of course, social anxiety). I don't spend much time online because I can't understand emotions, sarcasm, and such (I'm like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory). But Discord is something different. I started hearing the people's voice; for me, that's something. I'm a gullible and naive person. So the voices assure me that there is people out there and not bots (Trust me, I had instances where I thought the person I was texting with was an LLM or not who they claimed to be). 

Expect more from me; I'll publish more random rants.
