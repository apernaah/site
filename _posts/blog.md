# Who am I

My name is Aparna, I'm in my early twenties. I'm from Ernakulam and lives in the UK (I'll let you guess where I am from and currently is from the clues I give).

I grew up in a nuclear family which includes my father, mother and a brother. My Dad has his own proprietorship if I'm right. Mom works in the government sector. Bro works in a service company, he is married and his wife is a cool person.

I love physics, travelling, technology, food (although unknown food doesn't agree with me), rom-com movies, pop, classical, romantic, and melody songs.
