# Finding myself

### Explicit warning, triggering and nsfw topics ahead:

I used to be a pretty good singer, and used to call and prank my friends. I had a voice I loved, high and clear, until puberty hit and stole it from me. Growing up as the youngest boy among my cousins, I stood out. I had a brother I shared "guy" experiences with watching porn (I never cared about masturbating), talking about life but I was always surrounded by sister figures who cared for me. I think, in a way, I was always trying to be one of them. 
My real journey began somewhere between 14 and 15. While other boys were fascinated by girls, I was fascinated by being a girl.

I found my cousin sister's old clothes at my mom's house and started wearing them. During summer vacations, the first floor of that house became my sanctuary. My grandparents lived downstairs and never came up, so for those few months, I was free. I bought feminine inners online, I tucked away the parts of me that didn't feel right, and I made makeshift breasts to create a shape that finally made sense in the mirror. 

I thought I was just a crossdresser. I was embarrassed. I thought, “I like girls, so this is just weird. It will fade out.” 

But it didn’t fade. In fact, my understanding of my sexuality was much more complex than I admitted to anyone. I told people I was straight because I was raised to be a straight male. I convinced my family I was a "boy" by blending in, hanging out in male circles, talking about girls, relationships and sex and suppressing my feelings. But in secret, I had sex with men too. In those encounters, I wasn't just a guy with another guy; I explicitly took on the female role. It was the only way intimacy made sense to me. I still don't know if I'm a bisexual, pansexual or asexual.

When my grandfather passed away in 2019, I didn't just grieve him; I grieved the loss of my safe space. The dressing-up days were over. I moved on to my bachelor's degree, suppressed my "feminine self," and put the mask back on. 

## The Denial Phase

 Now, in 2025, the mask is heavy. I tried coming out to my roommates and my brother. Their reaction? Roommates told me it was a "hormonal imbalance" caused by my lifestyle and my brother told me it was caused by my eating habits. Everyone is in denial. My brother asked if I wanted
 to be like the caricatures in movies like (Njan Marykutty)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Njan_Marykutty] or (Super Deluxe)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Deluxe_(film)]. His tone made it sound disgusting, like a joke. I wish he understood that I see myself in respectful portrayals, like the character in (Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh_Kare_Aashiqui] or real icons like Trinetra and Gazal Dhaliwal. 
 
 My mother caught on my hint at shaving daily and growing out my hair, asking if I am transitioning and she threatened her own existence if I did. I know exactly how my father would react if he found out. So, for now, I stay silent to keep the peace. 
 
## Finding "Q" and Finding Myself 

Despite the family drama, something beautiful has happened. I met a guy online, let’s call him Q. He’s Malayali, which makes expressing myself so much easier, I'm very comfortable with malayalam than any other language. We started out bonding over movies and music, but then he started talking about *me* . He talks about seeing me in a saree, adorned with jewelry. That was very strange because I'm the kind of person who only wears a watch other than clothes but hearing this was exciting.

He talks about taking me on dinner dates and temple dates. He knows I am a pre-transition transfem, and he treats me as one. It’s a different feeling from my past encounters; this feels like romance. It’s validating in a way I can’t explain. Hearing him acknowledge me as a woman is intoxicating. 

The Contradictions of Me I know I don't fit the stereotype of what a transfem "should" be, and I’m learning to be okay with that: 

### I’m a geek, not a fashionista: I work in tech and don’t follow fashion trends, yet I get triggered seeing women's clothes in stores because I can't wear them yet. 

### I’m scared of surgery: I don’t want bottom surgery. I’m terrified of it. I just want to take hormones and simply be. 

### I live in the digital world: I always play female characters in video games, even in first-person shooters. It’s not to stare at them; it’s to hear the voice lines as I speak, to be addressed as "she," to exist as female in at least one universe. 

I still act like a boy to survive. Even if I transition, I'll wear t-shirts, jeans and shorts more as that is comfortable for me. But when I am alone, or when I am with Q, I am not that boy. I am the person who loves rom-coms, who plays romantic songs on loop, and who feels a peak of joy when someone calls me chechi (big sister) or ediii.
 
 I am still finding my voice, the real one this time.
