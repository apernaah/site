# Halloween Manifestation

For three years, I lived in a cycle of "next time." I told myself I’d girlmode by Halloween 2023, then 2024, then 2025. Each milestone passed, and I remained in the shadows of my own life. But on New Year’s Eve, the universe finally handed me the keys.

While traveling back from work, a notification lit up my phone: my gender dysphoria assessment report had arrived. More than just a medical document, this was my Gender Dysphoria Certificate. It was the bridge between who I was and who I am becoming. I had set a goal to enter the new year as Aparna, and seeing that report in my inbox made it feel real. I wasn't going to wait another day.

# The First Haul

I headed straight to a clothing store. I’ll admit, I went a bit overboard, but I felt like celebrating. I wandered into the lingerie section and filled a basket: bras, knickers, camis, shapers, leggings, tights, and a bodysuit. I moved to the beauty section for nail polish, lipstick, and a tube of lip gloss (I’m still not entirely sure why I bought the gloss, but it felt right at the time!). I already had plenty of feminine t-shirts, I’m a "tee and leggings" girl at heart so I felt like my foundation was finally complete.

# Midnight Euphoria

I shared the news with my closest friends; the couple, my best friends and my cousin and went to sleep. I woke up at 9 PM to get ready for work (Yea, there was work on christmas day as well). Under a baggy hoodie, I wore my new clothes, the bra pads giving me a silhouette that finally matched how I felt inside.

The night held one more surprise: my manager messaged at 10:30 PM to say I wasn't needed at work. The joy must have been all over my face, because my friends immediately whisked me away to the nearby park to see the fireworks and cut the cake. As the clock struck twelve and the fireworks shattered the sky, I heard it for the first time in person:

"Happy New Year, Aparna!"

To be called by my preferred name while being hugged by people who truly see me was overwhelming. They told me they would never oppose how I choose to live. Interestingly, they all still use my nickname, Thumbi (Dragonfly). It’s a name I’ve had since long before I came out which they gave, but because it’s androgynous, it carries a new sense of euphoria now. It’s the same "me" I’ve always been, just finally seen in the right light.

# The Retail Gauntlet
The last 20 days have been a blur of highstreet shopping. I’ve visited almost every outlet in the UK, but the "checkout jitters" haven't quite faded. I’ve developed a "shopping persona" to handle the anxiety: I stay on the phone or stare at a digital list so onlookers think I’m just running errands for someone else.

## A few moments from the journey so far:

1. The Workplace Stutter: I visited a different branch of my own company. When the cashier asked where I worked for the colleague discount, I was so caught off guard that I actually stuttered.

2. The "Incomplete" List: While shopping at my own store, I told my colleagues I was buying for a friend who "didn't give me the right sizes."

3. The TK Maxx Encounter: A lady at the store laughed or smiled at me while I was buying a single skirt,no carry bag, no other items. I just put it in my backpack, It was awkward, but I survived it.

4. The Hold Ups: I asked for hold ups (thigh highs) at one shop; the assistant asked, "For women?" and I found myself firmly answering, "Yes, for women."

# The In Between

I’m currently navigating a strange middle ground. My roommates are understanding, but I still feel a bit "weird" walking around in pyjamas, or skirts while my body is still in the early stages of this journey.

Socially, it’s a tightrope. I have photos in my new dresses that make me feel beautiful, people tell me I look cute! but I can't share them with everyone. My brother has made it clear he would block me if I send him. It’s a reminder that while some doors have opened, others remain heavy. If you want to see those photos and follow the real journey, you’ll have to find me on Instagram.

## What’s Next

I’m heading to India on the 28th, so the shopping spree is on pause until I return in late February. I still have M&S, H&M, and River Island on my list.

The "manifesting" stage is over. 2026 is officially the year I stop waiting for Halloween and start living every day as myself.
