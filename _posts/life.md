# The life I'm choosing

I’m approaching 25, and I need to be upfront about something: I never want to get married. This isn't a sudden, rebellious decision; it’s a deeply held conviction I've had since I was young.

## The Idea of Marriage is Not for Me

For me, the entire concept of marriage as defined by society and my culture feels overwhelming. It’s a huge, legally binding union of two entire families, complete with formal engagements, coordinating astrological charts, and a massive audience of extended relatives, colleagues, friends, and neighbors watching. I’m not concerned with the wedding days themselves, I'm concerned with everything that comes after. I'm opting out of all of it.

If I were ever to commit to someone, it would be purely for companionship. I want someone to talk to, someone to entertain, and a travel partner. My joy would come from their happiness; even if I'm sad, seeing them happy would bring a real warmth inside me.

## Defining My Boundaries

My desire for a deep connection exists outside of traditional norms, especially regarding intimacy. I identify as aegosexual, meaning I appreciate the idea of sexual activities and fantasies but have no desire to personally engage in them.

Regarding family, I'm not opposed to raising children, but I strongly prefer to adopt. A child needs a stable foundation and someone they can truly call their own, and that's a commitment I would be willing to make with the right partner.

## The Fear That Stops Me
I know I can be an "old-school" romantic. When I’ve been in relationships, I express my feelings through simple, movie-like gestures. But the moment commitment is on the table, I freeze. I am genuinely terrified of taking on the responsibility of a partner, and it comes down to a harsh self-awareness.

I couldn't adequately care for my own grandparents during their final days. All I could do was cry. I was paralyzed by the emotional weight of it. If I couldn't handle the fragility of my grandparents, how could I possibly take care of a partner when they are seriously ill?

I want to emphasize this isn't selfishness; it’s a profound fear of failure. I’m scared of people being disappointed by what I do or what I fail to do.

### This anxiety filters into everyday life, too:

I love cooking, but only for myself. If the food is bad, I’ll adjust. But if I serve it to someone else and they dislike it, or worse, get sick, I feel that same dread. It triggers the fear that I might accidentally harm or neglect a loved one, just like I was afraid of making a mistake that could hurt my fragile grandparents.

## My Career
The only areas of my life (and of others) where I consciously make decisions and take full control are my education and my career. This is where my focus lies.

I don’t aspire to be a manager, a leader, or an entrepreneur. I want to be an engineer and an excellent one at that. My Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) actually helps me here, ensuring whatever work I produce is perfect, no matter how long it takes.

I currently work in a place where my effort is recognized. I know my managers talk about my quality of work, though they don't say it directly to me. I dislike attention because it puts me on the spot, and if I fail, the disappointment of others feels crushing. That’s why I intentionally keep the expectations people have of me lower.


For now, I'm confident in my decision to channel my intensity and need for perfection into my work, where I know I can excel, rather than into a commitment where my deepest fears might lead to disappointment.
