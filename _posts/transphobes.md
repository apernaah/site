The worst people a trans person could encounter are "neutral" people. Someone who says they are just ignoring it and saying "be you" often turns out to be an actual transphobe.

Imagine one of your best friends (of 20 years) betraying you to your brother, who is actually neutral and not accepting by saying that I am just lying.

Imagine your roommate, who tells you, "I don't care what you do and I'm not going to interfere in what you do," then makes a scene when you are talking to a common friend.

The first incident happened about a week ago when my brother called me to tell me that whatever I'm saying is a lie and that I’m cooking up stories to convince people that I'm trans. For one thing, I'm not lying, and second, if I were lying, the reason is pretty obvious: I'm TRANS, you idiots.

Moving on to the second incident: I have four housemates. I talk to three of them about my things and they understand; that's all I need. I don't tell anything to the fourth person because he has ignored it since the time I came out. So I thought, "Yeah, he doesn't care, and neither should I."

Yesterday, my roommate and I went to a supportive couple's house, where other friends and the fourth roommate were also present. He's a 21yo who doesn't realize that 24/25yo are also Gen Z. One of the friends who was visiting started asking about my situation because he was curious; he doesn't know how transgender people's thoughts are. He asked about my sexuality.

I started explaining the difference between gender identity and sexuality, and another friend thought I was making a scene and that I had initiated the conversation, so he tried to stop the discussion. Seeing this, the fourth roommate started getting angry. Later, he came to me saying that I should not talk about this to anyone, including the supportive couple who has been there from the start. He told me that I shouldn't have come to last night's gathering. He kept telling me that he's been seeing everyone for the past three years and he knows what everyone is thinking and that I'm taking advantage of everyone and everyone is just "bearing" with me.

I asked him why I couldn't talk to the supportive people, and he replied that they are his friends and they only stayed friends with me because he kept them in the circle. I told him that they are the ones asking me for updates and that's why I share with them. So, he told me that he would talk to them to stop discussing the topic with me.

I told him that I talk with the other roommates every day, and he went mute for a while. Then he told me he would explain to me today when he's sober. He also mentioned that if the talk ever happens again, either I have to leave the house or he'll leave the house.

My question is: why is he getting angry if I'm talking about my stuff to supportive people? He should've ignored it like before. He's a sweet guy who cares about everyone, but just like every other human being, he doesn't care about the good things in me; he only gathers the bad stuff and shoots it at me.

Overthinking is a big issue for me. I overthink a lot and I anticipate things, but he is thinking on a different level. What is genuinely going on in his mind, no one knows.

I'm a people pleaser. I don't want to lose anyone over anything. I don't want enemies. It’s also very hard for me to make friends because of my social anxiety. So, people who read this, please send me your thoughts and opinions at hello@apernaah.in or https://instagram.com/apernaah
